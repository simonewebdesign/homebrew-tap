This is a Homebrew [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md) repository that provides the formula for [`elm-new`](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new).

In other words, it lets you install [`elm-new`](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new) like this:

    brew install simonewebdesign/tap/elm-new

Or, to upgrade:

    brew upgrade elm-new

For other ways to install [`elm-new`](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new), [see here](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new#installation).

---

At the moment, [`elm-new`](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elm-new) is the only formula available in this tap. Hopefully there will be more in the future.

If there were other formulas to install, this would be the generic shell command to run:

    brew install simonewebdesign/tap/<formula>

Or, alternatively, `brew tap simonewebdesign/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

You can also install via URL, but you will not receive updates:

    brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonewebdesign/homebrew-tap/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
